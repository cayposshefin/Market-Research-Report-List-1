<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Specimen Retrieval market is categorized into two primary types: detachable and non-detachable systems. Detachable systems allow for the separation of the retrieval device from the specimen, facilitating easier and safer extraction without damage, making them ideal for complex procedures. In contrast, non-detachable systems retain the specimen within the device until complete retrieval, minimizing the risk of loss or spillage. These distinctions cater to varying surgical needs and procedural efficiencies in managing specimens during medical interventions.</p></p>
