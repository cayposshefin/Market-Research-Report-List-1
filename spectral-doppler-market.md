<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spectral Doppler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Continuous-Wave Type</li><li>Pulsed-Waved Type </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spectral Doppler market is categorized into two primary types: Continuous-Wave (CW) and Pulsed-Wave (PW). Continuous-Wave Doppler uses a constant ultrasound wave, ideal for analyzing high-velocity blood flow, providing real-time data without depth limitations. In contrast, Pulsed-Wave Doppler emits short bursts of waves, allowing for depth-specific measurements, thus enabling more detailed assessments of blood flow in various vessels. These two types serve distinct diagnostic purposes in cardiovascular and other medical applications, enhancing clinical decision-making.</p></p>
